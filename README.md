# 350-final-project
CURRENT STATUS:
Functional CPU on FPGA board - LEDs reflect SW input switches, when we lw / sw to specific memory locations (see fpga_test1.s), we modify which LEDs are on.

GENERAL
When working on a new project, create a branch to preserve historical code.
On local device:
  //create new directory for project or navigate to existing directory
  git clone *insert https key here*
  //now, you will need to verify git login
  //if existing directory, then may need to pull from git to get most recent code
Then, add / commit -m / push code to update files
Once testing is complete, can merge back with main branch to update central code
